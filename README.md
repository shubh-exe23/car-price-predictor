# Car Price Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based car price prediction tool that estimates the selling price of a used car based on its specifications and market trends. It uses a Linear Regression model trained on real-world data from CarDekho, with an interactive interface built using `ipywidgets`.

## Features

- Predicts selling price based on:
  - Year of manufacture
  - Kilometers driven
  - Fuel type
  - Transmission type
  - Seller type
  - Ownership history
  - Car model
- Interactive user interface in Jupyter Notebook
- Price trend visualization for selected models
- Clean and beginner-friendly code structure
